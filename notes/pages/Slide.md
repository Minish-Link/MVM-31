	- had an idea rattling in my brain since we peak-brainstormed: iirc we talked about being able to home in/grapple enemies, and I was thinking, we could have another ability that lets you knock grounded enemies up into the air, so you could use them to gain extra height. I was thinking of something like a Slide move (which could also be used to serve other purposes)
